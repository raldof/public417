# smallchesslib

*A tiny public domain suckless chess library and engine for the benefit of all living beings.*

Smallchesslib is a small/suckless/KISS single header chess library that comes
with functions for playing the game, manipulating standard chess formats, and
even comes with a basic AI. The repository also includes a simple chess engine
built with the library.

The philosophy here is not to be the best, the fastest, to offer the strongest
AI or completely comply with all the standards, but rather to offer something
simple and very portable to people who want to create simple chess software.
There are many strong engines and complex libraries, but few that try to keep it
simple and portable in pursuit of understandability, maximum freedom and
friendliness to smaller projects. The library is completely in the public domain
under CC0 so as to serve everyone equally. This isn't made for any profit but
purely for the benefit of everyone.

## Features

- simple, **suckless**, **KISS**
- **single header** library
- pure **C99**, **well commented** source code
- completely **public domain free software** under **CC0**, owned by no one, zero conditions on use
- **no dependencies** (not even standard library, except for stdint)
- **no build system**, just compile
- basic functions: computing moves, estimating game phases, ...
- uses **no floating point**, mostly just 8 bit integer math
- uses **no dynamic allocation** on heap
- included simple CLI **engine**, *smolchess*, with (partial) **xboard** support (tested with xboard, pychess and lichess bot)
- very **efficient**, runs even on tiny **embedded** and **bare metal** systems such as Arduboy
  (2.5 KB RAM, 15 MHz CPU Arduino) and Pokitto (32 KB RAM, 48 MHz).
- printing chessboard in several formats (ASCII, UTF8, ...)
- simple internal board representation with ASCII characters, easy to manipulate
- **FEN**
- **PGN**
- **game recording**
- move **undos**
- simple **graphical rendering of the board** (48 x 48 1bit image)
- recursive position evaluation/analysis
- simple **psudorandom number generators**
- **chess 960** variant (Fischer random): starting position numbering/generation, compile-time option for 960 castling
- **board hashing**
- simple **AI** (traditional state tree search, no machine learning):
  - **rating about 1500+**: played on lichess under the nickname [smolchessbot](https://lichess.org/@/smolchessbot) (on Intel Core 2 Duo @2.66GHz, with base search depth 3)
  - evaluation function considering many aspects (material, pawn structure, king
    position, mobility, ...)
  - **alpha-beta pruning**
  - two kinds of extensions (extra search depth): exchange and check
- simple support for some variants (that only differ from chess by starting position)

## Limitations

- focused on traditional chess and chess960, very little support for variants with wildly different rules
- no UCI (only xboard)
- xboard support isn't full, it can't be used for analysis, just playing
- AI doesn't consider draw by 50 move rule and is only able to consider repetition draw in a limited way
- AI doesn't use any opening book or endgame tablebase
- AI always promotes to queen
- even though the effect is minized, AI still ocassionaly suffers from the horizon effect
- no transposition tables
- no move ordering during search
- no iterative deepening, time management is pretty primitive
- for memory reasons, draw by repetition only considers consecutive moves by default
- some advanced features like pondering are not implemented
- the library doesn't perform extensive checks and isn't super memory safe, don't give it garbage

## How To Use

Simply include `smallchesslib.h`, all code is in this one file, no need for linking. All functions and
other resources are also documented in this file, so take a look at it to see the library's API. For a
typical use you want to focus on the `SCL_Game` struct and its associated functions starting with
`SCL_game*`.
